## Motivation

Our goal this Brickhack is to learn and grow as developers. Each member of the team has a specific skill they wanted to focus on such as frontend development, data processing, and collecting system information. 

## Features

- Node express server that acts as the communication channel between the webapp and the agents
- Client agent runs as a service
- Client agent is compatible with Python 3.x and does not need any additional libraries installed
- Monitors the CPU usage, memory usage, bandwith incoming, bandwidth outgoing, and disk utilization
- Can generate reports about the status of a device and SSH logon attempts
- Reports give a high-level summary of the information pertaining to a device for someone in a security or IT related position

## How to Use

1. Download project using git or github zip
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`

## What we Learned

How to find any Ubuntu/Debian system information interfacing with the kernel directly through /proc/.

The difficulties of running on caffine alone.

No matter how much frontend you know, there is always going to be complications.

Regular expressions are goated.

HTML to PDF is a great tool for automating reports and other documents.

How to use D3.js for data visualizations.

Time management is crucial. This project was much more organized than our first BrickHack and it led to better execution and more time to refine the code.

Some Linux core binaries work through black magic and were not meant to be replicated.
